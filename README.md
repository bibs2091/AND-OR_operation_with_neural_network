# AND-OR_operation_with_neural_network
AND/OR operation with neural network training from scratch using octave 


I built neural network with the sigmoid as an activation function and zero hidden layer from scratch to do AND/OR logical operations using octave, you can also use it for the NOT operation, but not for the XOR operation ( you must have at least 1 hidden layer cause the y is not linear, which I didn't include in the source code).


the program function is the main function.
